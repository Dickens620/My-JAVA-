NCBMM (Natural Cluster Based Mean-and-Mode algorithm), RCBMM (attribute Rank
Cluster Based Mean-and-Mode algorithm) and KMCMM (k-Means Cluster-Based Meanand-
Mode algorithm). NCBMMis a method of filling in missing values in case of supervised
data. NCBMM uses the class attribute to divide objects into natural clusters and uses the
mean or mode of each cluster to fill in the missing values of objects in that cluster depending
on the type of attribute. Since most clustering applications are unsupervised, the NCBMM
method cannot be applied directly. The last two methods, RCBMM and KMCMM, can be
applied to both supervised and unsupervised data clustering.
RCBMM is a method of filling in missing values for categorical attributes and is
independent of the class attribute. This method consists of three steps. Given a missing
attribute a, at the first step, this method ranks all categorical attributes by their distance from
the missing value attribute a. The attribute with the smallest distance is used for clustering.
At the second step, all records are divided into clusters, each of which contains records with
the same value of the selected attribute. Finally, the mode of each cluster is used to fill in the
missing values. This process is applied to each missing attribute. The distance between two
attributes can be computed using the method proposed in (Mántaras, 1991) (see Section 6.9).
KMCMM is a method of filling in missing values for numerical attributes and is
independent of the class attribute. It also consists of three steps. Given a missing attribute
a, firstly, the algorithm ranks all the numerical attributes in increasing order of absolute
correlation coefficients between them and the missing attribute a. Secondly, the objects
are divided into k clusters by the k-means algorithm based on the values of a. Thirdly, the
missing value on attribute a is replaced by the mean of each cluster. This process is applied
to each missing attribute.
Cluster-based methods to deal with missing values and errors in data have also been
discussed in (Lee et al., 1976). Other discussions about missing values and errors have been
presented in (Wu and Barbará, 2002) and (Wishart, 1978).

1.5.2 Books on Clustering
Several books on cluster analysis have been published. The following list of books may be
helpful to readers.
1. Principles of Numerical Taxonomy, published by Sokal and Sneath (1963), reviews
most of the applications of numerical taxonomy in the field of biology at that time.
Numerical Taxonomy: The Principles and Practice of Numerical Classification by
Sokal and Sneath (1973) is a new edition of Principles of Numerical Taxonomy.
Although directed toward researchers in the field of biology, the two books review
much of the literature of cluster analysis and present many clustering techniques
available at that time.
2. Cluster Analysis: Survey and Evaluation of Techniques by Bijnen (1973) selected a
number of clustering techniques related to sociological and psychological research.

3. Cluster Analysis: A Survey by Duran and Odell (1974) supplies an exposition of
various works in the literature of cluster analysis at that time. Many references that
played a role in developing the theory of cluster analysis are contained in the book.
4. Cluster Analysis for Applications by Anderberg (1973) collects many clustering techniques
and provides many FORTRAN procedures for readers to perform analysis of
real data.

point of view. Awide range of procedures, methods, and examples is presented. Also,
some FORTRAN programs are provided.

written at an elementary level for researchers and graduate students in the social and
behavioral sciences.

scientific community that emphasizes informal algorithms for clustering data and
interpreting results.
8. Introduction to Statistical Pattern Recognition by Fukunaga (1990) introduces fundamental
mathematical tools for the supervised clustering classification. Although
written for classification, this book presents clustering (unsupervised classification)
based on statistics.

areas. Many examples of clustering are provided in the book. Also, several software
programs for clustering are described in the book.
